[API Documentation](https://gching.github.io/metaplex-js/)

`metaplex-js` is a JavaScript API wrapper around [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) and it's programs on Solana.
Through this library, you can interact with Metaplex such as querying for auctions or creating your NFT. This
library can be used in Node.js or in the browser.

A lot of the implementation is based on the work done at https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex.

## Disclaimer
This is currently a **WIP** and a lot of features are missing or stale in implementation. 
If you need to a fully featured marketplace and support  all the available features, please refer and 
use https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex.

At the current moment, only the querying and fetching of specific program accounts, such as an auction or a store. In
addition, this library is not published anywhere.

## Getting Started
To start using `metaplex-js`, you will be initializing an instance of `MetaplexAPI`, which will be the class that you
will use to interact with the entirety of Metaplex.

```ts
import { MetaplexAPI } from "metaplex-js";

/**
 * Pass in the Solana RPC endpoint you would like to use and use the default settings
 */
const metaplex = new MetaplexAPI({
    endpoint: 'SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT'
})
```
